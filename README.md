# 🚀 MLOps with MLflow

This project demonstrates a complete **MLOps (Machine Learning Operations)** workflow using **MLflow** — including experiment tracking, model versioning, and model registry — for efficient end-to-end management of machine learning lifecycle.

---

## 📂 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to show how to implement **MLOps principles** to automate and manage the lifecycle of machine learning models.  
It includes:

- **Data ingestion** and preprocessing  
- **Model training** and experiment tracking using **MLflow**
- **Model evaluation and logging**
- **Model registry and deployment**
- **Version control** using Git

---

## 🧠 Key Concepts Covered

- **Experiment Tracking:** Log parameters, metrics, artifacts, and models with MLflow Tracking.
- **Model Registry:** Manage and version your ML models in the MLflow Model Registry.
- **Reproducibility:** Store all experiments and results for consistent reproduction.
- **Automation:** Simplify retraining, versioning, and deployment processes.
- **Collaboration:** Use GitHub and MLflow UI for team-based ML development.
